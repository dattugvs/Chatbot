If Pause combined his knockback with his flame bow it might work out. Wasn't a good idea for him to go in for melee in the first place though.
And you had to ruin it...
Nice place but communal laundry!

She asked for help and got sass.  I'd be pretty upset.
I can understand leaning on Pierce. At least Rasual and Martell stayed on the bench.
Um no, this is purely a cap move. They're in a bind next season which would give us an advantage on them. newlinechar  newlinechar Edit: I think I heard people saying a 2-3rd rounder and a 7th for him?

I can't believe anyone can make it through 20 minutes of Rush Limbaugh.
Yeah, definitely. Hipster Felicia is dumb as hell, and making Morrigan the Succubus into anything but super-silly-sexy seems pretty ridiculous.

As in Kurds, Christians, Shias, Alawites, Armenians and every other minority that does not bend to their will. They are utterly intolerant of people with different views than themselves.

I still don't think Newspapers, TV and Radio are 'a dying media', but there is a TON of consolidation going on. I know a lot of great people in all three who are selling cars because of it. More work, less employees.

I think Alopecia or Elephant Eyelash are both good enough to be on the essentials. 
Fine. It is still not Carvajal and there is probably the biggest dropoff in quality from starter to backup in this position. I also can't think of any right back that I would rather have.

I don't know him. I was a fan of Lostprophets. I was at a Fall Out Boy concert, saw him in the crowd, spoke to him and that happened. I didn't think much of it at the time because I had a crush on him. God he is so gross.

The protesters ended up a bit defeated after a failed recall election.  There are still frequent protests and rallies at the Capital, but they aren't all over Act 10, and none of them are nearly as large.

Yes. Sodium is an electrolyte. It helps regulate water volume in a cell. Water is ultimately what keeps muscles full. Lots of people cut sodium for, like, no fucking reason other than that they think it's 'unhealthy'.

You're right. I'm actually a *really* good cook - my dad worked in culinary arts and taught me a lot. I just hate the hour of prep, eating, and then cleanup. Basically I'm lazy. 
Its a strawman of the big nang theory, abiogenesis, and a bit of  evolution by natural selection at then end. None of them are actually related to atheism.
Yeah. Unlike Kassadin.
not that I'm aware of. there might be - but definitely not to this extent. This is only possible because Hideo spends so much time polishing his games.

Sure.  Puffs aren't limited to female only. Catch rate is 75% female, 25% male.
Agreed, they may not have been an explicit part of the design of melee, but a frame 1 set-knockback/low KBG move (falco) leads to very 'scripted' combos.
